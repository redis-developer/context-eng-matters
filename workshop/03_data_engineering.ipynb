    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of vector search optimization techniques in Redis,\n",
    "examining the trade-offs between search quality, latency, and memory usage. We evaluate multiple\n",
    "indexing strategies including HNSW and FLAT indexes across datasets ranging from 10K to 10M vectors.\n",
    "Our results demonstrate that careful index configuration can improve search latency by up to 10x\n",
    "while maintaining 95%+ recall. We also introduce novel compression techniques that reduce memory\n",
    "usage by 75% with minimal impact on search quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Vector databases have become essential infrastructure for modern AI applications, enabling semantic\n",
    "search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Redis, traditionally known\n",
    "as an in-memory data structure store, has evolved to support high-performance vector search through\n",
    "the RediSearch module. However, optimizing vector search performance requires understanding complex\n",
    "trade-offs between multiple dimensions: search quality (recall), query latency, memory usage, and\n",
    "index build time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper makes three key contributions: (1) A systematic evaluation of HNSW parameter configurations\n",
    "across different dataset sizes and query patterns, (2) Novel compression techniques that reduce memory\n",
    "footprint while preserving search quality, and (3) Practical recommendations for production deployments\n",
    "based on real-world workload analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[... continues for several more pages ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background and Related Work\n",
    "Previous work on vector search optimization has focused primarily on algorithmic improvements to\n",
    "approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Malkov and Yashunin (2018) introduced HNSW (Hierarchical\n",
    "Navigable Small World), which has become the de facto standard for high-dimensional vector search.\n",
    "Johnson et al. (2019) developed FAISS, demonstrating that product quantization can significantly\n",
    "reduce memory usage. More recently, Guo et al. (2020) proposed DiskANN for billion-scale search\n",
    "with SSD-based storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these works primarily focus on standalone vector search systems. Our work specifically\n",
    "addresses the unique challenges of integrating vector search into Redis, a multi-model database\n",
    "that must balance vector search performance with other data structure operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[... continues ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performance Analysis and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 HNSW Configuration Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 shows the performance comparison across different HNSW configurations. As M increases from 16 to 64,\n",
    "we observe significant improvements in recall (0.89 to 0.97) but at the cost of increased latency (2.1ms to 8.7ms)\n",
    "and memory usage (1.2GB to 3.8GB). The sweet spot for most real-world workloads is M=32 with ef_construction=200,\n",
    "which achieves 0.94 recall with 4.3ms latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1: HNSW Performance Comparison\n",
    "| M  | ef_construction | Recall@10 | Latency (ms) | Memory (GB) | Build Time (min) |\n",
    "|----|-----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| 16 | 100            | 0.89      | 2.1          | 1.2         | 8                |\n",
    "| 32 | 200            | 0.94      | 4.3          | 2.1         | 15               |\n",
    "| 64 | 400            | 0.97      | 8.7          | 3.8         | 32               |\n",
    "\n",
    "The data clearly demonstrates the fundamental trade-off between search quality and resource consumption.\n",
    "For applications requiring high recall (>0.95), the increased latency and memory costs are unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The recall-latency trade-off can be modeled as a quadratic function of the HNSW parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency(M, ef) = α·M² + β·ef + γ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- M = number of connections per layer (controls graph connectivity)\n",
    "- ef = size of dynamic candidate list (controls search breadth)\n",
    "- α, β, γ = dataset-specific constants (fitted from experimental data)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our e-commerce dataset, we fitted: α=0.002, β=0.015, γ=1.2 (R²=0.94)\n",
    "\n",
    "[... continues ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementation Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our findings, we recommend the following configuration for real-world deployments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Optimal HNSW configuration for balanced performance\n",
    "index_params = {\n",
    "    \"M\": 32,                  # Balance recall and latency\n",
    "    \"ef_construction\": 200,   # Higher quality index\n",
    "    \"ef_runtime\": 100         # Fast search with good recall\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration achieves 0.94 recall with 4.3ms p95 latency, suitable for most real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "Our findings demonstrate that vector search optimization is fundamentally about understanding\n",
    "YOUR specific requirements and constraints. There is no one-size-fits-all configuration.\n",

    "**1. Data Modeling is the Foundation of RAG Quality**\n",

    "- Long-form documents with multiple distinct topics\n",
    "- Research papers, technical documentation, books, legal contracts\n",
    "- Improves retrieval precision by reducing irrelevant context\n",
    "- Research-backed: \"Lost in the Middle\", \"Context Rot\" show why structure matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Three Chunking Strategies**\n",
    "- **Document-Based (Structure-Aware):** Split by sections/headers - best for structured documents\n",
    "- **Fixed-Size (Token-Based):** Split into fixed chunks with overlap - best for unstructured text\n",

    "> **Chunking isn't about fitting in context windows - it's about data modeling for retrieval.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Just like you wouldn't store all customer data in one database row, you shouldn't embed all document content in one vector without thinking about retrieval patterns.\n",

    "Now that you understand data modeling and chunking for knowledge bases, you'll learn to manage conversation context:\n",
    "- **Working Memory:** Track conversation history within a session\n",
    "- **Long-term Memory:** Remember user preferences across sessions\n",
    "- **Memory-Enhanced RAG:** Combine retrieved knowledge with conversation memory\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Analyze Your Data\n",
    "Think about a dataset you work with. Answer these questions:\n",
    "1. What is the natural retrieval unit?\n",
    "2. Does it need chunking? Why or why not?\n",
    "3. If yes, which chunking strategy would you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Design a Chunking Strategy\n",
    "For each document type, choose the best approach:\n",
    "1. Product catalog with 1,000 items\n",
    "2. 50-page technical manual with chapters\n",
    "3. Customer support tickets (avg 200 words each)\n",
    "4. Legal contracts (avg 20 pages, multiple clauses)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Experiment with Chunking\n",
    "Take the research paper example and:\n",
    "1. Try all three chunking strategies\n",
    "2. Compare the number of chunks and average size\n",
    "3. Which strategy would work best for queries about \"HNSW configuration\"?\n",
